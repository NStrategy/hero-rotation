Hi,

I will use this file to communicate over Github.
To contact me, please send a message on Discord to: kekwxqcl

Please remember to download either the whole folder or the specific Spec.lua files and the Rogue.lua as well as the Settings.lua
If you downloaded my files and there is an issue, please reach out to me directly. Offical support cannot be given as this is a fork, not the offical version.
I will keep all Rogue specs up to date/make homebrew adjustments as necessary.
If you have any suggestions or if there are any issues, please reach out to me via comments or message me on Discord.
