Hi,

I will use this file to communicate over Github.
To contact me, please send a message on Discord to: kekwxqcl

Please remember to download the specific Spec.lua files and the Rogue.lua as well as the Settings.lua
IF YOU WANT A FIX FOR IMPROVED GARROTE, DOWNLOAD THE FOLLOWING FILE: https://github.com/NStrategy/hero-lib/blob/dragonflight/HeroLib/Events/PMultiplier.lua (You need to install it in Herolib -> Events)
If you downloaded my files and there is an issue, please reach out to me directly. Offical support cannot be given as this is a fork, not the offical version.
I will keep all Rogue specs up to date/make adjustments as necessary.
If you have any suggestions or if there are any issues, please reach out to me via comments or message me on Discord.
