Hi,

I will use this file to communicate over Github.
To contact me, please send a message on Discord to: kekwxqcl

Please remember to download either the whole folder or the specific Spec.lua files and the Rogue.lua as well as the Settings.lua
If you downloaded my files and there is an issue, please reach out to me directly. Offical support cannot be given as this is a fork, not the offical version.
I will keep all Rogue specs up to date/make homebrew adjustments as necessary.
If you have any suggestions or if there are any issues, please reach out to me via comments or message me on Discord. 

----------------Notes for Specs----------------

Updated CT conditions to the newest APL

Added certain Priority Targets

Outlaw.lua:
Working.
Homebrew:
Usage of Thistle Tea aligns with the Rogue Discord FAQ.
Usage of RtB aligns with the Rogue Discord FAQ.
Changed BF condition to reflect the comment of the APL string more precisely (at least from what I saw in the sims)
Added condition to fill missing Combo Points with BF while 3 or 4 targets are in BF range. If at 3 cp, and 3 enemies are present, and you dont have Broadside, it would suggest BF. If you had Broadside, it would not suggest it as you would overcap (aligns with the Rogue Discord FAQ.)
Added functional KiR condition (aligns with the Rogue Discord FAQ.)

Subtlety.lua:
Working.
Homebrew:
Secret use from 2 to 3.1
