Hi,

I will use this file to communicate over Github.
To contact me, please send a message on Discord to: kekwxqcl

For now, I will only give support for Assassination and Subtlety Rogue, as the Outlaw Re-Roll-Code is a bit over my head lol.

Update to 10.2!
Please remember to download either the whole folder or the specific Spec.lua files and the Rogue.lua as well as the Settings.lua
I will keep all Rogue specs up to date/make homebrew adjustments as necessary.
If you have any suggestions or if there are any issues, please reach out to me via comments or message me on Discord. 

DISCLAIMER: Before you message me, saying that the rotation is wrong, look at the behaviour in the sim and understand it. As much as I would like to have this to be "Plug n' Play", it often isnt that easy, especially when talking about a reworked class. If you truly think something is wrong, point out precisely what is wrong: video, in-depth text guide, talents and so on. I cannot fix something as broad as "This isnt here, why?".
