Hi,

I will use this file to communicate over Github.
To contact me, please send a message on Discord to: kekwxqcl

For now, I will only give support for Assassination and Subtlety Rogue, as the Outlaw Re-Roll-Code is a bit over my head lol.

Update to 10.2!
Please remember to download either the whole folder or the specific Spec.lua files and the Rogue.lua file.
Once the offical version of HR updates, I will keep all Rogue specs up to date/make homebrew adjustments as necessary.
If you have any suggestions or if there are any issues, please reach out to me via comments or message me on Discord. 



----------------Notes for Specs----------------

Assassination.lua:
The Assassination.lua file is largely current.
Will need to look at the newest APL once it is officially published and update the code.

Outlaw.lua:
The Outlaw.lua is not yet supported, but will be supported as soon as the offical version is out.

Subtlety.lua:
The Subtlety.lua file is current.
Should work accordingly.
There is some code pertaining to Tier-31 that still requires implementation; this will occur once HeroLib updates.

Rogue.lua:
All abilites are implemented.
Will implement trinkets once my game updates.
